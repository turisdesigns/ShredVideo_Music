					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

					<h5>Effective Date: December 14, 2015</h5>

					<p>This Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how Shred Video, Inc. (&ldquo;Shred Video&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) treats information collected or provided in connection with an end user&rsquo;s (&ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;user&rdquo;) use of the Shred Video website located at www.shredvideo.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and any associated mobile application (theâ€¨&ldquo;App&rdquo;) (the Site and the App are collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). Please note that your use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of this Policy as set forth below:</p>

					<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Service is intended for use by individuals over the age of 18, and Shred Video does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are a parent and believe that your child under the age of 13 has used the Service and provided personally identifiable information to us through the Service, please contact us at info@shredvideo.com or the mailing address at the end of this Policy and we will work to delete that Service account and any such personally identifiable information.</p>

					<p><strong>1. <u>Effective Date; Changes.</u></strong> This Policy applies to all information collected by or provided to us on and after the Effective Date. When we make any material changes to this Policy, we will change the Effective Date above. We will treat your continued use of the Service following such change as your acceptance of the changes.</p>

					<p><strong>2. <u>Third Parties.</u></strong> We may offer through the Service or send to registered users links to or offers from third parties. This Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to or that may be collected by third parties. We encourage you to request such third parties to provide you with their applicable privacy policies and other terms and conditions before engaging with or making a purchase from such third parties.</p>

					<p><strong>3. <u>Information Collected on the Service.</u></strong></p>

					<p><strong>Submitted Information.</strong> When you create an account with the Service, we collect the information you provide in the registration form. At a minimum, this information consists of your name and e-mail address, and may also include any videos, music and metadata you may provide (collectively, the &ldquo;Media&rdquo;). We will also collect other information you choose to provide to us through customer service requests and other communications you may initiate. To the extent you decline to share certain information with us, we may not be able to provide some or all of the features and functionalities found on the Service.</p>

					<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information.</strong> When you use the Service, we gather certain non-personally identifiable information from you, and this information can be associated with your user account and information you submit to us. This includes usage information, such as information on when, how often and for how long you use the Service, how much and the type of Media you upload, as well as server log data such as a device&rsquo;s IP address, MAC address and operating system version.</p>

					<p><strong>Payment Information.</strong> When you subscribe to premium membership through the Service, we ask for your credit card, billing address or other payment information. We use third-party payment services providers to process payments on our behalf, and as a result, we do not actually receive your credit card number or other payment instrument information.</p>

					<p><strong>Social Networking Information.</strong> We may allow you to create your Service account by logging in through a social networking site such as Facebook (&ldquo;Social Services&rdquo;).

Please remember that the manner in which Social Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policies of each Social Service, and not Shred Video.</p>
