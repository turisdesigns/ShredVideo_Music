# ShredVideo_Music
Updated ShredVideo website with new updated landing page (music). New files include music.html, music.css, music.js, images inside img folder, videos inside video folder.


This repository contains the music landing page extension for the official ShreVideo website. This new addition expands the existing brand identity—originally focused on action sports—into the music and nightlife entertainment space.

The landing page includes a modern, responsive design and embedded video and image assets to showcase music-related content. The page is designed to act as a standalone experience or as part of the larger ShreVideo ecosystem.
